Binary search is a lot faster than simple search. (It only works when an list is in sorted order)

O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you're searching through grows.

Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds.

Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.

Algorithm itmes are written in Big O notation.
